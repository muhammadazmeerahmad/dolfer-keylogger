# Keylogger Project

## Overview

This project is a **Python-based keylogger** designed for educational purposes. It records keystrokes, saves the data in a local file, and sends periodic keylog reports via email.

### Features:
- **Keystroke Logging**: Captures keystrokes and saves them in `keylog.txt`.
- **Email Reports**: Sends captured logs to a specified email every 2 minutes.
- **Session Management**: Logs the start and end of each session.
- **Background Operation**: Runs silently in the background after being compiled to `.exe`.
- **Persistence**: Optionally configure auto-start on system boot via the registry (Windows).

### Ethical Disclaimer:
This keylogger is **for educational purposes only**. Unauthorized use or deployment without consent is **illegal** and **unethical**. Always obtain explicit permission before using any keylogging software.
